# No-Code Visual Agent Builder (v6)

**Educational Code Demonstrating the ADK Visual Agent Builder**

This project introduces the **ADK Visual Agent Builder**, a powerful no-code/low-code feature for creating, configuring, and visualizing multi-agent systems. The builder is accessed through the `adk web` command and provides a browser-based, drag-and-drop canvas for designing agent workflows without writing Python code.

This example walks through the process of setting up the environment and using the visual builder to create a simple "web page generator" agent. It covers both manual configuration and the use of the experimental, Gemini-powered **Builder Assistant**.

**Note:** The Visual Agent Builder is a very new and experimental feature in the ADK. As you will see in the walkthrough, some features may have bugs or incomplete functionality. This example is intended to provide a foundational understanding of this evolving tool.

## 📦 Features

- ✅ **No-Code Visual Builder:** Use a drag-and-drop canvas to design and configure your agents.
- ✅ **Live Web Interface:** Launch a local web server with `adk web` that hosts the builder and a chat UI for testing.
- ✅ **YAML Configuration Backend:** The visual builder creates and modifies standard ADK agent `.yaml` configuration files in your local project directory.
- ✅ **Gemini-Powered Builder Assistant:** An experimental AI assistant that can help you design agent workflows from a natural language prompt.
- ✅ **Simple Example Use-Case:** Demonstrates how to build a single `LlmAgent` that can generate a complete, self-contained HTML/CSS/JS web page from a user query.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project structure is minimal, as the focus is on the workflow within the `adk web` UI. The agent configurations you create will be saved into subdirectories.

```text
./version_6_adk_nocode/
├── web_page_generator_2/      # Contains agent config created manually in the UI
│   └── root_agent.yaml
├── web_page_generator_3/      # Directory for the agent built with the assistant
│   └── root_agent.yaml        # (May be empty due to experimental nature)
├── outputs/
│   └── output1.html           # An example HTML file generated by the agent
├── main.py
├── pyproject.toml
└── README.md
```

---

## 🚀 Setup & Launch

### 1. Set Up Python Environment
**Required:** Python 3.12+, uv, and Git.

```bash
# Navigate to the project root
cd version_6_adk_nocode

# Create and activate a virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate.bat on Windows

# Install all dependencies
uv sync
```

### 2. Add Your API Key

Create a `.env` file in the `version_6_adk_nocode` project root:

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key"
```

You can get a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com). The `adk web` command will automatically detect and use this key.

### 3. Launch the Visual Builder

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
adk web
```

This will start a local web server. Open the URL provided (usually `http://localhost:8000`) in your browser to access the ADK Web UI.

## 🧠 Walkthrough: Building a Web Page Generator

This walkthrough mirrors the steps shown in the accompanying video tutorial.

### Part 1: Manual Agent Creation (`web_page_generator_2`)

First, we will create an agent manually using the builder's configuration panel.

1.  **Create a New Agent:** In the web UI, click the **`+`** button next to the agent selection dropdown. You will be prompted to name your new agent. Enter `web_page_generator_2` and click "Create".
2.  **Configure the Agent:** You will be taken to the Visual Builder canvas. A configuration panel for your new agent will appear. Fill it out as follows:
    *   **Agent Type:** `LlmAgent` (This is the default for a new agent).
    *   **Model:** `gemini-2.5-flash`.
    *   **Description:** `single page website builder agent`.
    *   **Instruction:** `Build a single unified HTML + CSS + JS document that is a webpage as per the user query`.
3.  **Save the Agent:** Click the **"Save"** button. You will be redirected back to the main chat interface.
    *   **Behind the Scenes:** At this point, the ADK has created a `web_page_generator_2` directory with a `root_agent.yaml` file containing the configuration you just entered.
4.  **Chat with the Agent:**
    *   Make sure `web_page_generator_2` is selected in the dropdown.
    *   Enter a prompt in the chat box, for example: `Build a generic landing page template`.
    *   The agent will generate and stream a complete HTML document in the chat window.
5.  **View the Output:** You can copy the generated HTML code, save it to a file (like `outputs/output1.html`), and open it in a browser to see the final web page.

### Part 2: Using the Builder Assistant (Experimental)

Next, we will try to create a similar agent using the experimental Gemini-powered assistant.

1.  **Create Another Agent:** Click the **`+`** button again and create a new agent named `web_page_generator_3`.
2.  **Use the Assistant:** This time, instead of using the manual configuration panel, go to the **Builder Assistant** panel on the right.
3.  **Prompt the Assistant:** In the assistant's chat box, describe the agent you want to build:
    > `Build an agent that makes a single unified HTML, CSS, plus JS doc based on a user query.`
4.  **Follow the Conversation:** The assistant will ask clarifying questions (e.g., which model to use). Respond to its prompts. It will then propose a plan and ask for confirmation before creating the agent files.
5.  **Review the Result:**
    *   **Expected Behavior:** The assistant should create the `root_agent.yaml` file for `web_page_generator_3` with the correct instructions.
    *   **Current Status (possible bug):** As of ADK `v1.18.0`, this feature is highly experimental. In testing, the assistant confirms the plan but often fails to write the content to the `root_agent.yaml` file, leaving it empty or with default content.

This highlights the current, developmental state of the Visual Agent Builder. While the manual configuration is functional, the AI-assisted features are still a work in progress.

File: agents/questions_researcher/agent.py
Purpose: Defines the Questions Researcher Agent system that contains five specialized LLM agents
         running in parallel to research and answer the five questions generated by the 
         questions_generator agent. Each sub-agent focuses on researching one specific question
         using Google search to provide comprehensive, well-researched answers.

This is the second agent in the website building pipeline that:
1. Receives 5 questions from questions_generator_output
2. Runs 5 specialized agents in parallel (one per question)
3. Each agent researches its assigned question using Google search
4. Outputs 5 separate research results for the query_generator to merge

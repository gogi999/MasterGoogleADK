Purpose: Defines the Query Generator Agent that synthesizes and merges research outputs from
         all five question researcher agents into a single, comprehensive query for webpage
         development. This agent acts as a bridge between the research phase and the 
         requirements writing phase of the website building pipeline.

This is the third agent in the website building pipeline that:
1. Receives research outputs from all 5 question researcher agents
2. Analyzes and synthesizes the research findings
3. Transforms research insights into web development context
4. Creates a single comprehensive query for the requirements writer
5. Outputs the merged query for webpage requirement generation

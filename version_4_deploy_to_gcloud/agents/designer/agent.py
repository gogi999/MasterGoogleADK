File: agents/designer/agent.py
Purpose: Defines the Designer Agent that transforms detailed webpage requirements into
         comprehensive visual design specifications. This agent acts as a pragmatic
         UI/UX designer, converting functional requirements into concrete design
         guidelines that developers can implement without ambiguity.

This is the fifth agent in the website building pipeline that:
1. Receives detailed requirements from the requirements_writer agent
2. Establishes a global design system (colors, typography, spacing)
3. Translates requirements into specific visual design specifications
4. Creates section-by-section design details with exact values
5. Outputs structured design specifications for the code_writer agent
